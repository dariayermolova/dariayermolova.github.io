The inclination of the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic is 17.14°. The semimajor axis of the Pluto orbit is 5.906 billion km, but due to the large eccentricity, the distance of Pluto from the Sun varies from 4.437 billion km at perihelion to 7.376 billion km in aphelion. The direction of rotation around its axis in Pluto, like that of Venus with Uranus, is the opposite, that is, opposite to the direction of revolution of the planets around the Sun. The days on Pluto last 6,387 terrestrial days.
